# Planetary Soft Landing with KSP
The goal of this project is to implement the convex optimization method for planetary soft landings described in ["Lossless Convexification of ... the Soft Landing Optimal Control Problem"](http://www.larsblackmore.com/iee_tcst13.pdf) and similar papers, in a heavily-modified build of the hobbyist flight simulator Kerbal Space Program.

UPDATE (3/25/2022): As of the last commit on 9/5/2020, this project proved the feasibility of implementing convex optimization-based planetary soft landing guidance in Kerbal Space Program. See the video results [here](youtube.com/watch?v=mvvMpNAnOws).
